# Code Improvement Analysis

## Security Improvements Needed
1. Database credentials are hardcoded in config.php - should be moved to environment variables
2. Session management in Auth.php could be improved with additional security headers

## Architecture Improvements
1. Add proper dependency injection instead of static methods
2. Implement proper error handling and logging throughout
3. Add input validation layers
4. Add interfaces for main service classes
5. Implement proper environment configuration

## Code Quality Improvements
1. Add PHP type hints throughout the codebase
2. Implement consistent error handling
3. Add proper PHPDoc blocks
4. Implement unit tests
5. Add consistent return types

## Performance Improvements
1. Add caching layer for frequently accessed data
2. Optimize database queries
3. Implement connection pooling
4. Add rate limiting for API endpoints

Would you like me to proceed with implementing any of these specific improvements?
